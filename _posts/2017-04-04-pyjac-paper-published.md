Our paper describing [pyJac](https://github.com/SLACKHA/pyJac) has been
published in *Computer Physics Communications*:
 * Journal version: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2017.02.004>

pyJac is an open-source Python-based tool that produces analytical Jacobian
matrices for chemical kinetics differential equations. This paper describes the
theory behind pyJac, including derivation of the chemical kinetic Jacobian and
all necessary components, pyJac's implementation, verification of pyJac's output,
and a performance comparison with alternative methods.
